Tasks: Explore the data to discover patterns in happiness. For each graph, make sure to include appropriate labels and comment on what it tells you. Use ggplot to do the following:
1) Produce an appropriate graphical display for the Year variable.
2) Create a data frame that includes only the 2017 data, and do the following:
a) For each variable (by itself), create an appropriate graphical display.
b) Produce graphs of Happiness as the dependent (y) variable and each of the other variables as the
independent (x) variables. For scatterplots, include a smoothed curve (geom_smooth) for each
one as well. Which variable appears to be the most correlated with happiness?
c) Create a new variable called SocialSupportCategory, which equals 1 if the value of that country’s
SocialSupport is above the median and 0 if it is not. Check that it was created properly. Use the factor function to assign labels of “low” and “high”, respectively, to SocialSupportCategory. Create an appropriate graphical display of the SocialSupportCategory variable.
d) Produce a scatterplot of Happiness as the dependent (y) variable and LogGDPPerCapita as the independent (x) variables, with SocialSupportCategory as the color aesthetic. Then, redo the graph with the FreedomToMakeLifeChoiceCat as the color aesthetic instead.
e) Create one graph that includes Happiness, LogGDPPerCapita, SocialSupportCategory, and FreedomToMakeLifeChoiceCat.
3) Choose at least three, but no more than about eight, countries from the data that are of interest to you. a) Explain why you chose those countries. (This part will not be graded – I am just curious)
b) Produce a graph of Happiness over time, with a different color for each country you chose.
c) For these countries, use only the 2017 data to produce at least two graphs of Happiness as the
dependent (y) variable and another variable as the independent (x) variable.
